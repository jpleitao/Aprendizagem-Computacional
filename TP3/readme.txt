To run the application run the "run.m" file, which will start the graphical interface. Once this graphical interface appears, the user can select the type of network to create and train, defining its specifications and its training properties, such as the source of the training data set, the learning rate, among others. The user can also select the type of classification to perform: We provide two different classification types: Individual Classification and Group Classification.

Once all the network's properties and parameteres are defined, the user can train the network by clicking on the "Train Network" button, and then can also run the trained network for the defined test data set, by clicking on the "Test" button. If the user selects the "Test" button before clicking the "Train Network" button, a neural network will be created, using the current defined configuration in the graphical interface. If the user hasn't defined any configuration, then a default one will be used.

After the trained network is run for the defined test data set, its results are displayed in the "Results" panel, featuring the network's sensibility and specificity, and the number of correct, incorrect and invalid classifications registered.
